# Python-Web-Task-List

Here is my code for my simple Python task list made for the browser using the Flask framework, with a simple login. To run it, simply download and run the main Python file, and open the link it generates. 

I definitely made this with functionality over form in mind, so while it is not the cleanest looking page, it does function properly
Nevertheless, I will find some time to try and improve the aesthetic appeal of this application.
